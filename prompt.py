Each bounding box should be in the format of (object name, [top-left x coordinate, top-left y coordinate, box width, box height]) and should not include more than one object. The spatial relationship between any two objects should satisfy the following two relationships: Non-Overlapping Horizontal Space: For any two rectangles, the horizontal space occupied by one should not intersect with the horizontal space occupied by the other. This means that the right edge of the first rectangle should be to the left of the left edge of the second rectangle, or vice versa. Mathematically, for rectangles rect1 = (x1, y1, w1, h1) and rect2 = (x2, y2, w2, h2), this condition can be expressed as either x1 + w1 <= x2 or x2 + w2 <= x1. Non-Overlapping Vertical Space: Similarly, for the vertical space, the bottom edge of the first rectangle should be above the top edge of the second rectangle, or vice versa. In terms of coordinates, for the same rectangles rect1 and rect2, this condition is met if either y1 + h1 <= y2 or y2 + h2 <= y1.
